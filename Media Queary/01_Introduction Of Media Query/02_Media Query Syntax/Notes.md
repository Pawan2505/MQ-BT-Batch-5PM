<!--  
    MEDIA QUERY: 

    Media queries help make a website responsive by adjusting styles based on screen width (breakpoints).  
    A responsive website is mobile-friendly and adapts to different device sizes.  

    Breakpoints define specific width ranges where styles change.  
    Below are common breakpoints:
    
    1. Extra Small (XS)  -> width < 576px  
    2. Small (SM)        -> 576px to 767px  
    3. Medium (MD)       -> 768px to 991px  
    4. Large (LG)        -> 992px to 1199px  
    5. Extra Large (XL)  -> 1200px to 1399px  
    6. Extra Extra Large (XXL) -> width >= 1400px  
-->

<!--  
    WIDTH USAGE IN MEDIA QUERIES:  

    - Media queries can use `min-width` (for styles applying above a width)  
    - Or use `max-width` (for styles applying below a width)  

    Example:
    - `@media (min-width: 768px) {}` applies styles to screens 768px and larger.
    - `@media (max-width: 767px) {}` applies styles to screens smaller than 768px.
-->

<!--  
    HOW TO USE MEDIA QUERIES EFFECTIVELY:  

    1. Write CSS normally for the default layout.  
    2. Use media queries only when you need to override styles at certain breakpoints.  
    3. Avoid repeating CSS inside media queries if itâ€™s already defined in the main stylesheet.  

    Example:
    - If `.navbar` already has styles in the main CSS, only add new styles in the media query.
-->

@media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 800px) {
    .navbar {
        /* Add only the styles that need to change for this screen range */
    }
}
